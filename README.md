# guess-the-number--user-input-
Try to see if the computer can guess your number!

We have 2 objects, the user and the computer. They get instantiated by the classes User and Computer (which both contain some methods).
And we have a function, that interacts with the 2 objects.
When we run the function, the user is asked to enter a number. After that, the computer is going to generate(guess) a random number.
If the number the computer generates is the same as the user's, then the computer wins. 
In the end, you can choose to play again against the computer.
